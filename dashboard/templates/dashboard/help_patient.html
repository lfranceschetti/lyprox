    Narrow down the subset of patients by their characteristics, like HPV 
    status or whether they are smokers. To do so, put the toggle buttons in 
    one of the following three states:
</p>

<ul class="fa-ul" style="list-style: none;">
    <li>
        <span class="fa-li">
            <i class="fas fa-plus"></i>
        </span>
            Only patients are selected where the respective characterisitc is *positive*. E.g. in the case of "smoking status" this would select all smokers.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="fa-li">
            <i class="fas fa-ban"></i>
        </span>
            This selection means that no filtering will be performed regarding the corresponding patient characteristic.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="fa-li">
            <i class="fas fa-minus"></i>
        </span>
            Selecting this will only include patients in the subset that do not have the respective characteristic or it is negative (e.g. not-smoking or HPV negative).
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="notification is-info is-light">
    <strong>Note:</strong> Just below the buttons there are three numbers that 
    give a preview of how many of the currently selected patients can be 
    categorized according to the respective characteristic.
</p>

    <strong>Warning:</strong> Dont forget to hit <strong>compute</strong> after 
    you have changed your selection criteria.
