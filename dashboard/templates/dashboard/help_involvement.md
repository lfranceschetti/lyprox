Here the most important information is visualized. For each side of the neck (ipsilateral being the same side as the tumor, contralateral the opposite) it displays a row for each LNL. From left to right, that row consists of...

* its roman numeral label (e.g. **IV**)
* a three-way toggle-button to select a subset with a particular involvement pattern 
* and a horizontal stacked bar that displays the ratio of patients with reports of <span class="tag is-danger p-1">metastases</span> in that LNL to patients that appear to have a <span class="tag is-success p-1">healthy LNL</span>. Numbers to the left and right of that bar plot indicate the absolute numbers and give a brief explanation when hovering over them with a mouse pointer.
