Here the most important information is visualized. For each side of the neck (ipsilateral being the same side as the tumor, contralateral the opposite) it displays a row for each LNL. From left to right, that row consists of...

* its roman numeral label (e.g. **IV**)
* a three-way toggle-button to select a subset with a particular involvement pattern 
* and a horizontal stacked bar that displays the ratio of patients with reports of metastases in that LNL <strong class="has-text-danger">(red)</strong> to patients with a healthily appearing LNL <strong class="has-text-success">(green)</strong>. Numbers to the left and right of that bar plot indicate the absolute numbers and give a brief explanation when hovering over them with a mouse pointer.
