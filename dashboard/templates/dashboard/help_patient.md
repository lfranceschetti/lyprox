Narrow down the subset of patients by their characteristics, like HPV status or whether they are smokers. To do so, put the toggle buttons in one of the following three states:

<span class="icon is-small mr-2"><i class="fas fa-plus"></i></span> Only patients are selected where the respective characterisitc is *positive*. E.g. in the case of "smoking status" this would select all smokers.

<span class="icon is-small mr-2"><i class="fas fa-ban"></i></span> This selection means that no filtering will be performed regarding the corresponding patient characteristic.

<span class="icon is-small mr-2"><i class="fas fa-minus"></i></span> Selecting this will only include patients in the subset that do not have the respective characteristic or it is negative (e.g. not-smoking or HPV negative).

    <strong>Note:</strong> Just below the buttons there are three numbers that give a preview of how many of the currently selected patients can be categorized according to the respective characteristic.
