# Our goal

Head & neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) frequently metastasise through the lymphatic network. Hence, radio-oncologists often have to decide whether or not to include the different lymph node levels (LNLs) - anatomically defined regions in the head & neck that contain several lymph nodes - into the clinical target volume (CTV).

To aid them in their decision, the prevalence of metastatic involvement for HNSCC has been described and reported in much detail. However, the detailed patterns and correlations between frequently metastatic LNLs remain insufficiently quantified. To tackle this, we extracted a dataset of 287 oropharyngal SCC patients and we will report their patterns of lymphatic metastatic progression in their raw format (a CSV table) soon.

To make this data more accessible and especially easier to understand and draw conclusions from, we developed this web-based interface and in particular the [dashboard](/patients/dashboard) where one can interact with the underlying data in a more intuitive way.

Beyond that, the dataset can be used for inference and risk prediction using a [dynamic lymphatic progression model](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-91544-1) that we have developed, too.
