   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

==================================
Welcome to LyProX's documentation!
==================================

Here we try to give a good overview of the Django app's API. Understanding how 
LyProX was written is certainly not necessary to make good use of it. But since 
we are mere humans and make mistakes, maybe this documentation might help 
someone spot errors we overlooked. Or it just helps others that want to build a 
Django websie themselves with parts of the implementation.
