# Interface to explore lymphatic progression patterns in HNSCC

Previously, the prevalence of metastatic involvement for head & neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has been described and reported in much detail. However, the detailed patterns and correlations between frequently metastatic lymph node levels (LNLs) remain insufficiently quantified. To tackle this, we extracted and published a dataset of 287 oropharyngal SCC patients and report their patterns of lymphatic metastatic progression in their **raw format** (a CSV table).

To make this data more accessible and especially easier to understand and draw conclusions from, we developed this web-based interface and in particular the [dashboard](/patients/dashboard) where one can interact with the underlying data in amore intuitive way.

If you can read this, my latest CD-test worked.
